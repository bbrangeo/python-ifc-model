# IFC model
helper classes to load and store data from IFC into a smaller JSON for easier access across different platforms.

Note that we ignore all geometric representations and focus on the more complex elements (buildings, storeys, spaces, products) because the representation is already handled by ifc-openshell and its export for e.g. Blender
