# IFC model
wrapper around [IfcOpenShell](http://ifcopenshell.org/) to load and store data from IFC into a smaller JSON-format for easier access across different platforms.

âš  Note that we ignore all geometric representations and focus on the more complex elements (buildings, storeys, spaces, products) because the representation is already handled by ifc-openshell and can be export (e.g. for Blender)

See [ifc-blender](https://github.com/brean/ifc_blender) for a usage example.
